      <em>
        I just want to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me and how deeply I appreciate you. You have this incredible way of making my days better even on the toughest days. Whether it's the little things you do without a second thought or the big gestures, your kindness and patience amaze me every day. I know I can be a difficult person sometimes â€“ I may not always express my feelings the way I should, and I might get caught up in my own head, but please know that it's only because I care so deeply about you. Even when I do not always show it in the best ways, my love and appreciation for you is real. You're my safe space and my greatest supporter, and I am so grateful to walk through life with someone as <strong>amazing</strong> as you. Thank you for being you and not changing anything about yourself since I met you. I truly would not be who I am without you by my side, and I cherish every moment we share. You are my greatest gift, and I hope you always know how deeply loved and appreciated you are.
      </em>
